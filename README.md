Hi, I'm Tien-Hao Chen.

A Mechanical Engineer pursuing a career in robotics, striving to revitalize Taiwan’s traditional industries—once the backbone of its economy but now challenged by labor shortages and rising minimum wages. By introducing robotics, I aim to help these industries transition to high-end, customized production, enabling smarter and more efficient manufacturing processes.

A former college baseball player who struggled with time management, leading to a drop in GPA. However, I turned this challenge into a learning opportunity, developing strong scheduling skills to balance academics and athletics successfully.
